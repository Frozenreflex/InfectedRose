# InfectedRose.Lvl
Each LEGOÂ® Universe Zone (See InfectedRose.Luz) is accompanied with multiple LVL files.
These contain information for objects, skybox, and environmental particles.

The file contains weird addressing and padding which makes it hard to write. Due to this, 
this library can only read read LVL files, not write them. For the time being.
